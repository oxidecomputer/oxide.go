# v0.4.0 (2025/Apr/15)

Generated from Oxide API version [20250409.0.0](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/rel/v14/rc1/openapi/nexus.json)

### Breaking changes

- **Integers as pointers:** All integers within the SDK's types are now `*int`. This is due to Go's handling of 0 as the empty value. This is specifically necessary when a field is an integer and also not required. [#274](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide.go/pull/274)

### New features

- **Anti-affinity groups:** CRUD methods. [#269](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide.go/pull/269)

### Notes

This release is solely a version bump. Since pkg.go.dev does not recognise git tags with metadata suffixes,
we are not able to set build metadata like the previous version. See associated [commit](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/pkgsite/+/343631).
